Summary of Project Implementation and Progress
So far, the project has established a foundational pipeline for a multimodal misinformation detection system using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The implementation followed a modular structure, with key components organized into a clear workflow:

Data Ingestion: A data_ingestion script was created to simulate real-world data collection. It generated a small, dummy dataset with metadata for "posts," including sample text and images, and assigned them a "fake" or "real" label.

Multimodal Feature Extraction: The feature_extraction script used pre-trained models to convert the raw data into numerical features:

Text: DistilBERT was used to create text embeddings.

Images: The backbone of a pre-trained ResNet-18 was used to generate image embeddings.

AI Detection: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) AI detector was trained in Google Colab (using dummy data for this PoC). The final model was integrated into the pipeline to produce a new, single-dimensional feature: a numerical score indicating the likelihood of an image being AI-generated.

Graph Construction: The graph_builder script combined these features. It created a heterogeneous graph where content nodes were linked to a single, dummy user node. The content node features were a concatenation of the text embedding, image embedding, and the AI detection score.

GNN Training and Evaluation: A custom HeteroGNN model was defined and trained on the graph. A separate evaluate_model script was then used to perform inference and generate standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and a confusion matrix, successfully verifying the pipeline's functionality on the small dataset.

This entire process was a foundational exercise to prove the pipeline works, but as you correctly identified, it's not yet ready for practical application.

Key Technical Challenges and Library Glitches
The most significant issue encountered throughout this process was the versioning conflict between NumPy 2.x and other core scientific computing libraries, particularly scipy and scikit-learn. The core problem was that libraries compiled against the older NumPy 1.x API would fail when a newer NumPy 2.x version was present in the environment.

Specific Errors: We repeatedly saw AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found and ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import traceback messages.

The Solution: The resolution required a painstaking process of:

Completely uninstalling all conflicting libraries (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, torch-geometric).

Explicitly installing a known-good version of NumPy (1.26.4).

Reinstalling all dependent libraries (scipy, scikit-learn, etc.) after NumPy was locked in, forcing them to either use the correct NumPy version or be rebuilt against it.

This highlights a common and frustrating problem in the Python data science ecosystem, where dependency management can become a major obstacle, even in a small PoC.

Strategies for Real-World Improvement and Next Steps
To transform this PoC into a more robust, real-world system, we must focus on improving the data, model complexity, and library management.

Data Scalability and Diversity:

Use the Full Fakeddit Dataset: Instead of a dummy dataset, the project should be adapted to ingest and process the full Fakeddit corpus. This would provide thousands of real-world text/image pairs with real labels, offering a much more meaningful training environment.

Add More Modalities: The content node could be expanded to include video features, user metadata (e.g., user age, post frequency), and interaction data (e.g., number of comments, upvotes).

Model Enhancement:

Feature Models: Use a larger, more powerful image embedding model like a Vision Transformer (ViT). For the text, consider a fine-tuned version of BERT trained specifically on a large social media text corpus to better capture subtle nuances.

Graph Structure: The graph is currently very simplistic. A real-world graph would include:

More Node Types: Add nodes for hashtags, communities, comments, and users.

Richer Edge Types: Define edges for posts (user to content), comments on (user to content), reposts (user to content), and mentions (user to user). This would allow the GNN to learn from how information spreads, not just what it contains.

GNN Architecture: Experiment with more advanced GNNs like Graph Attention Networks (GATs) or Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGTs), which are specifically designed to handle complex relationships in heterogeneous graphs.

Alternative Libraries and Frameworks:

Unified Frameworks: Consider using a more unified deep learning framework like TensorFlow/Keras. While it also has its own dependency ecosystem, using it for both feature extraction (via TensorFlow Hub) and graph processing (via TensorFlow GNN) could simplify dependency management by keeping everything within a single-vendor ecosystem.

Dependency Management: To prevent future issues, strictly define all dependencies in a requirements.txt file and manage the environment with a tool like conda or a more modern Python tool like poetry or pipenv. This ensures a reproducible environment where everyone works with the same, verified library versions.
